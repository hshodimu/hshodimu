- 👋 Hi, I’m Hakeem Onyedikachi Shodimu but friends call me Onye for short. I'm used to coming up with ideas for apps and games, so I decided why not apply that creativity to something useful. I'll say i'm enjoying the process of becoming a software engineer quite a bit. After joining the ITSM/software development world and seeing the passion and ingenuity of fellow devs, I knew I found my home. My goal is to build my skills and knowledge to a point where I'm capable of offering insight, expertise and products as a contribution to our community (my bad if that sounds corny, i know lol. just speaking from the heart) 
- 👀 Professionally I develop and maintain applicaitions for ITSM business needs (modules that auto-write records into databases, triggering email notifications when forms are submitted, etc. super exciting stuff). In my personal time I bring my passion projects to life and unleash them on the world. My passion is taking never-before-realized ideas/solutions from my conception, and bringing it into the shared experience we call reality (in the form of software :shipit:)
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Javascript as my native language. APIs consider my communication skills rough around the edges (what do you mean that variable wasn't defined?? We're 5 functions deep in this callback function and you wait now to tell me?!) Ahhh, how sweet it rolls off the tounge.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an idea for a board game application as my first personal project. I'm keeping it a secret until I get far enough in its design and development. But I don't believe has ever been programmed before
